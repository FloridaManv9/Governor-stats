# Governor-stats

Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, has gotten himself into a tough spot. He's been pushing to reopen the 
state in order to get the economy moving once again; however, it's starting to look like the Covid-19 
virus may not let him do this.  
Governor DeSantis believes that the infection rate in Florida can't be as bad as it is be portrayed on 
national news shows. Currently Florida ranks third in terms of states with the greatest number of new 
Covid-19 infected residents. Governor DeSantis believes that more testing is not required, but rather 
faster processing of the collected Covid-19 test data. He's looking for help in doing this. 
The Governor has contacted USF for assistance; however, all of the medical school people who would 
normally lend a helping hand are currently involved in conducting vaccine field trials. What this means is 
that USF has come to their last line of defense: you. 
The Governor is going to provide you with a data file that contains test data that has been collected 
from local sites in Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Tampa, and Brandon. He's asking that you write a Python 
program that will take in the data that he is providing you with and will process it in order to answer 
some key questions that he is currently being asked by the media.  
 
Sample Data Sets: 
 
The data file that you will be provided with will contain data in the following format:  
sex, age, height, weight, positive / negative, zip code
